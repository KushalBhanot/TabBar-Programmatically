# TabBar-Programmatically

I wanted to implement TabBar for a project. So here, basically I've implemented the native features that UIKit offers to implement TabBars.

#### Process:
- Setup a VC to act as an entry point for TabBars
- Make the root VCs for the tabs
- Embed the root VCs of tab in a NavigationController
- Play with design

And that's how you setup TabBars in iOS using UIKit.
